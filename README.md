# Obsidian-shortcuts-extender

A small plugin that allows you to assign shortcuts to enter special characters - so that you can fully use the markdown markup if you write notes in a language other than English.
So far, the following keyboard shortcuts have been assigned:
- Alt + 3 for input #
- Alt + cyrillic "х" or "ъ" for input []
- Alt + Shift + cyrillic "б" or "ю" for input <>

If you enter square brackets or comparison signs, having previously selected the text, then the text will be enclosed in brackets (in the case of square brackets, a pair will be put at once)


## Install notes

Place the files `manifest.json` and `main.js` in your `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/` folder.
